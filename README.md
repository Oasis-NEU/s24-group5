# Northeastern Map App

## Overview

The **Northeastern Map App** is designed to improve campus navigation for students at Northeastern University by utilizing unique tunnel routing options and advanced pathfinding algorithms. This project was developed from January 2024 to March 2024 as a solution to optimize campus travel times by providing faster, more efficient routes compared to traditional online map software.

The key highlight of the project is its use of **Dijkstra's Algorithm** implemented in a **Node.js API**, achieving ~30% faster campus travel times.


## Features

- **Optimized Routing**: Uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between points on campus.
- **Tunnel Routes**: Unique to Northeastern University, the app incorporates the tunnel system to provide more efficient paths.
- **API Integration**: The application is built on a **Node.js API** to handle routing requests.
